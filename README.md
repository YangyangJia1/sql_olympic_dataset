## Introduction
 The Olympics are leading international sporting events featuring summer and winter sports competitions in which thousands of athletes from around the world participate in a variety of competitions. The Olympic Games are considered the world's foremost sports competition with more than 200 nations participating.The Olympic Games are held every four years, with the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart. The dataset has over 1000 athletes, events for summer and winter games. My goal is to shed light on major patterns in the Olympic games, what are the characteristic of the athletes, how many events and countries are there? where do most athletes come from? who win the most medals? I query each table by using SQL and report by Tableau.
